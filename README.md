Matching Logic Proof Checker
---

This repository contains:
  - A formulation of [matching Î¼-logic](http://www.matching-logic.org/index.php/Matching_Logic)
    in Metamath (`theory/matching-logic-*.mm`)
  - A formalization of [Kore](https://github.com/kframework/kore) in matching logic (`theory/kore-*.mm`)
  - An interactive theorem prover specialized for matching logic (`ml/itp`), [more info](ml/itp)
  - A automated prover that can generate proofs of concrete rewriting in Kore, given
    a Kore definition and a trace

## Dependencies

The itp and rewrite prover use Python (3.7+). Some dependencies are required:
```
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Note that we have been using the K version at tag `v5.0.0-bbc70cb` or commit hash `bbc70cb`.
The newer version might generate different axioms for rewriting.

## Examples of generating proofs for concrete rewriting

Suppose you have a K definition `def.k` with the main module `MAIN`,
and a program `pgm.txt`, you can use

```
python3 -m scripts.run-test def.k MAIN pgm.txt --output rewriting-proof
```
to generate the (concrete) rewriting proof for the program `pgm.txt` and output to the `rewriting-proof` directory.

Once that's done, you can use Metamath to verify the proof:
```
$ metamath rewriting-proof/goal.mm
...
77192945 bytes were read into the source buffer.
The source has 9148 statements; 4352 are $a and 1776 are $p.
No errors were found.  However, proofs were not checked.  Type VERIFY PROOF *
if you want to check them.

```

## Unification

This is the minimal example for map unification:

https://github.com/kframework/matching-logic-proof-checker/tree/main/examples/map-test

```
requires "domains.k"
module MAP-TEST
    imports MAP
    syntax KItem ::= select(Map, KItem)
    rule select(Key |-> Val _:Map, Key) => Val
endmodule
```

There are three programs in that directory:

```
pgm-no-aci.map-test
select(1 |-> 2 2 |-> 3, 1)
pgm-id.map-test
select(1 |-> 2, 1)
pgm-comm.map-test
select(1 |-> 2 2 |-> 3, 2)
pgm-ac.map-test
select(1 |-> 2 2 |-> 3 3 |-> 4, 3)
```

If you run
`python3 -m scripts.run-test examples/map-test/map-test.k MAP-TEST examples/map-test/pgm-no-aci.map-test --output tmp`
to prove the rewriting of `pgm-no-aci.map-test`, it would work
but for the other three programs, it would give an exception about not being able to find rewriting axioms for the pattern

Essentially two things have to be done (or how I would do it):
1. We need to find all the ACI axioms for maps. This kind of thing is currently done in this loop over all axioms: https://github.com/kframework/matching-logic-proof-checker/blob/main/ml/rewrite/env.py#L522. And one would need to somehow identify what the ACI axioms would look like for maps (or ideally for any constructors), then store it in some new fields of the ProofEnvironment class
2. Then once we have this information, the rest of the changes can be implemented in this file: https://github.com/kframework/matching-logic-proof-checker/blob/main/ml/rewrite/unification.py. Namely, in the class `UnificationProofGenerator`, one needs to implement the unification of two map patterns.
